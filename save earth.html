    <p style="color:white">All the animals we'll see over the course of the series are disappearing because of one species: humans. We know that we are using more than our fair share of the planet and its resources and we must now redress this imbalance. Any effort to do so no matter how big or small is valuable, if we wish to ensure a future that is healthy for all life on planet Earth so we have to save earth from various types of Pollution, Waste food, Drained Water etc. The earth is our mother planet in which we born and understand learn to speak, learn to walk and learned everything that we are now able to do. "It is only planet in our solar system on which life exists which incredible biodiversity. People all over the world celebrate this grand event all to protect flora and fauna and clean up the earth on which we live. Our life will be wasted if we have no any goal. Without any goal we will feel unlucky, waste life etc. But if we don't Save Planet Earth then, our Earth will be destroyed and we can't live. So, Save Planet Earth.we can save our earth by the following.</p><marquee behavior="" direction=""><img src="./earth.png" alt=""></marquee>

        <li><h2>Saving Gorillas</h2></li>
        <p>The <a href="western lowland gorilla.html"> western lowland gorilla </a>is the smallest subspecies of gorilla but still has exceptional size and strength. This species of gorillas exhibits pronounced sexual dimorphism. They possess no tails and have jet black skin along with coarse black hair that covers their entire body except for the face, ears, hands and feet. The hair on the back and rump of males takes on a grey coloration and is also lost as they get older. This coloration is the reason why older males are known as "silverbacks". Their hands are proportionately large with nails on all digits (similar to those of humans) and very large thumbs. They have short muzzles, prominent brow ridges, large nostrils and small eyes and ears. Other features are large muscles in the jaw region along with broad and strong teeth. Among these teeth are strong sets of frontal canines and large molars in the back of the mouth for grinding fruits and vegetables.</p>
        <li><h2>Saving Tigers</h2></li>
        <p>Tigers have been a protected species for many years, but despite this they are increasingly threatened by extinction due to poaching and increasing conflict with humans. But can the spiritual and deeply felt respect for tigers held by ordinary Indians offer a lifeline for the species? Newsreader Fiona Bruce reports from Bandhavgarh National Park, where acclaimed wildlife cameraman and tiger expert Alphonse Roy has been watching and filming them for 20 years.</p>
        <li><h2>Saving Crocodiles</h2></li>
        <p>DJ Edith Bowman travels 6,000 miles to Cambodia on the trail of the very rare Siamese crocodile, which was hunted to brink of extinction. Now, conservation charities such as The Wildlife Conservation Society and Fauna and Flora International are working in partnership with the Cambodian government and have established a crocodile farm to increase the population size.</p>
        <li><h2>Saving Albatross</h2></li>
        <p>Carol Thatcher flies to the Falkland Islands to find out why the black-browed<a href="./albatross.html"> albatross </a>and its relatives are under threat. Albatross numbers have plummeted in recent years due to long-line fishing practices.</p>
        <li><h2> Saving Rhinos</h2></li>
        <p>Former England cricketer Phil Tufnell reports from Assam in India, one of the last remaining homes of the Indian rhinoceros. Fewer than 2,000 are left in the wild due to poaching for their horns.</p>
        <li><h2>Saving Wolves</h2></li>
        <p>In the southern part of the Ethiopian Highlands, a remote mountain region and the last home of the Ethiopian wolf, Graham Norton discovers that encroachments by the ever-expanding human population is threatening the wolf's survival.</p>
        <li><h2>Saving Elephants</h2></li>
        <p>Adrenaline junkie Jack Osbourne journeys to northern Namibia to investigate the plight of the desert elephant. Although saved from extinction by the banning of the ivory trade, the desert elephants now face a new threat. Local people once roamed the land as migrants, but their recent conversion to farming has brought them into conflict with elephants over precious resources.</p>
        <li><h2>Saving Turtles</h2></li>
        <p>Of the seven remaining species of sea turtle, six are seriously threatened with extinction. Saira Khan travels to Sri Lanka, one of the best places in the world to see turtles, but even here commercial fishing practices and pressure on the turtles' nesting beaches are driving numbers down.</p>
        <li><h2>Saving Orangutans</h2></li>
        <p>TV presenter Nick Knowles reports from Borneo, where orangutan numbers are being decimated due to the deforestation of the island and the growth of palm plantations. He visits a sanctuary where more than 600 orphaned young apes are cared for. Their mothers are usually killed by plantation workers, because the orangutans are attracted to the palms for food and can damage the crops. Their young are taken for the pet trade or are simply left to die, but those lucky enough to be rescued are brought to the sanctuary. Now, it simply can't cope with the number of apes being brought in and desperately needs extra funds. This programme was incorporated into the live fundraising broadcast</p>
        <li><h2>Save water</h2></li>
        <p>Water is inextricably linked to energy and climate change. Energy is required for pumping and treating water that we get at home. Pumping and treating wastewater is energy intensive. Conservation of water indirectly conserves therefore, conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>Climate change will also impact freshwater supply. Global warming is resulting in shifting rainfall patterns, an increase in the number of dry days, torrential rainfall over short periods of time, and extreme weather events, all of which increase the likelihood of droughts and floods. It, in turn, will affect food supplies and human health. Water is expected to be a major source of conflict in future because demand is soaring and freshwater reserves are severely stressed. Plummeting groundwater resources in many regions and inefficient use of water is a matter of serious concern.</p>
        <P>Despite adequate rains, we face a shortage of water for drinking, agriculture, industry and sanitation. It even leads to conflicts among neighbours – people and provinces. Wastage of water can be avoided through various ways. Rainwater harvesting can recharge our lakes and ground aquifers. Farmers can avoid excessive flooding of fields. In our houses, we have plenty of scope for reducing consumption. Pollution of water by the discharge of wastes is itself a serious problem, as cleaning it for reuse by humans requires lot of efforts and energy.</P>
        <li><h2>Pollution</h2></li>
        <p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.[1] Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat, sound, or light). Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.</p>
        <p>Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally implies that the contaminants have an anthropogenic source – that is, a source created by human activities, such as manufacturing, extractive industries, poor waste management, transportation or agriculture. Pollution is often classed as point source (coming from a highly concentrated specific site, such as a factory or mine) or nonpoint source pollution (coming from a widespread distributed sources, such as microplastics or agricultural runoff).</p>
        <p>Many sources of pollution were unregulated parts of industrialization during the 19th and 20th centuries until the emergence of environmental regulation and pollution policy in the later half of the 20th century. Sites where historically polluting industries released persistent pollutants may have legacy pollution long after the source of the pollution is stopped. Major forms of pollution include air pollution, light pollution, litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, visual pollution, and water pollution.</p>
